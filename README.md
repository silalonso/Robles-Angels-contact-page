Welcome to our contact page! :computer: <br />
This was the first group project we made at **Adalab**, and we are very proud of it.<br />

You can see the web here: [Robles' Angels](https://beta.adalab.es/project-promo-i-module-1-team-4-morning/)  :arrow_left:

### :deciduous_tree: :angel: Why "Robles' Angels" ?    

We needed to find a better and more appealing name for our team than "group 4", so we looked up for some inspiring women, and Sara found her: **Ángela Ruiz Robles**.

##  :woman: Who was Ángela Ruiz Robles?
She was born in 1895 in Villamanín, Leon, and died in 1975 in Ferrol, A Coruña.<br />
She was a Spanish teacher, writer, pioneer and inventor of **the mechanical book, precursor to the electronic book**.<br />

In 1949, she was awarded Spanish patent 190,698 for the "Mechanical Encyclopedia" (Spanish: la Enciclopedia Mecánica).<br />

Her pourpose was to lighten the weight of the books carried by her students, so she created a device consisting of a series of text and illustrations on reels, all under a sheet of magnifying glass with a light for reading in the dark, and was to incorporate spoken descriptions of each topic. Her device was never put into production but a prototype is in display at the National Museum of Science and Technology in A Coruña.<br />

So we decided to name us after her.


## :busts_in_silhouette: How did we organized ourselves during the project?

In Adalab We were teached **Agile** Philosophy in the **Scrum** framework.<br />
So the first day we chose the **Scrum Master** for the first sprint, and then we wrote our **working agreements**.<br />
Everyday we did the **Daily meeting**, in which we shared our progress, as well as our coding doubts to the team.<br /> 
Together we solved the issues, and carried on with the project.<br />
We had two **sprints**, of two weeks each. :calendar: <br />
At the end of the second sprint, we did the **product presentation and demo** to our teachers and colleages.<br />
After that, we had the retrospective meeting, or **Retro**, in wich we analized:

- What we did well, to keep on doing it. :thumbsup:
- What we did not so well, to make it better next time. :point_up:
- What we did bad, to stop doing it in the future. :no_entry_sign:
- And what we did that maybe we should do a little bit less in the future.:point_down:

We also shared **feedback** about the strenghts and improvement oportunities of each of us, because it's very important to know ourselves, and to know what the others are perceiving about us.



## :wrench: What did we use?

For this project we used:
- HTML5 
- CSS3 
- Sass 
- Gulp
- Git
- Github

We initialized the repository using the **[Adalab Web Starter Kit](https://github.com/Adalab/adalab-web-starter-kit)**.<br />


First, we made the outline in html, to see how many sections we had.<br />
Then we chose who will take charge of each section.


## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Conclusions 

They were 4 hard weeks, because it was our first contact with programming, and everything was new. <br />
But we would repeat it without hesitation. <br />
Here the foundations of a future were laid, and now we are already walking.:tada:
