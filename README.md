Welcome to our contact page! :computer: <br />
This was the first group project we made at **Adalab**, and we are very proud of it.<br />

### Why "Robles' Angels" ?    :deciduous_tree: :angel:

We needed to find a better and more appealing name for our team than "group 4", so we looked up for some inspiring women, and Sara found her: **Ángela Ruiz Robles**.

## Who was Ángela Ruiz Robles?
She was born in 1895 in Villamanín, Leon, and died in 1975 in Ferrol, A Coruña.<br />
She was a Spanish teacher, writer, pioneer and inventor of **the mechanical book, precursor to the electronic book**.<br />

In 1949, she was awarded Spanish patent 190,698 for the "Mechanical Encyclopedia" (Spanish: la Enciclopedia Mecánica).<br />

Her pourpose was to lighten the weight of the books carried by her students, so she created a device consisting of a series of text and illustrations on reels, all under a sheet of magnifying glass with a light for reading in the dark, and was to incorporate spoken descriptions of each topic. Her device was never put into production but a prototype is in display at the National Museum of Science and Technology in A Coruña.<br />

So we decided to name us after her.


## How did we organized ourselves during the project?

In Adalab We were teached **Agile** Philosophies in the **Scrum** framework. So everyday we did the **Daily meeting**, in which we shared our progress, as well as our coding doubts to the team. Together we solved the issues, and carried on with the project.
We had two **sprints**, of two weeks each. :calendar: <br />
At the end of the second sprint, we did the **product presentation and demo** to our teachers and colleages.<br />
After that, we had the retrospective meeting, or **Retro**, in wich we analized:

-What we did well, to keep on doing it. :thumbsup:
-What we did not so well, to make it better next time. :point_up:
-What we did bad, to stop doing it in the future. :no_entry_sign:
-And what we did that maybe we should do a little bit less in the future.:point_down:

We also shared **feedback** about the strenghts and improvement oportunities of each of us, because it's very important to know ourselves, and to know what the others are perceiving about us.
